      "Only 44% of assumed clinically eligible patients are offered a clinical trial. One reason for this is underlying bias in the recruiting process. When the doctor was speaking to the first patient, her use of clinical language to describe the trial showed her that it was both scientifically sound and personally beneficial for the patient. But when the doctor spoke with the second patient, she used more general language to describe the clinical trial based on the assumption that he had a lower level of health literacy due to his race and accent. One barrier doctors face when recruiting underrepresented patients is mistrust in the medical system; using specific language conveys respect for the patient, which in turn builds trust",
